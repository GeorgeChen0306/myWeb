<h1>My Simple Social Media Web Page along with a calculator</h1>

<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>Hi and welcome to my web page. I developed this web app just to showcase my web development skills as both front-end (not very experienced with it) and back-end, so the designs are going to be sloppy and not very stylish.</p>

<br />
<h2>Web Page Featues</h2>
<p>In this project, I developed a small platform where the users can create and view posts made by themselves or the others.</p>
<p>This project also includes a calculator that can only do basic arithmetic operations such as adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing. </p>
